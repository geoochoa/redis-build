# redis-build
Documenting read/exercises of "Build Your Own Redis with C/C++‚Äù by James Smith.

## Link to reading
https://build-your-own.org/redis/

## What
I just wanted to understand redis on a deeper level and this book bundled that in with some concepts I've been wanting to review.

### Why
It simultaneously serves as further network programming, multi-threading, data structures and C/C++ review which is an added bonus.
All exercises will be heavily commented as accurately summarizing seems like another good test for understanding.
